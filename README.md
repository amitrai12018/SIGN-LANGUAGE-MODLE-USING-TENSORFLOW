THIS IS A DEMO PROJECT AS A PART OF DEEP LEARNING COURSE FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF TENSORFLOW .
 NOTE: PART 1 OF THE ASSISMENT HAS A TENSORFLOW TUTORIAL .MAIN PART  OF THE DEMO PROJECT THAT IS MODEL FOR LEARNING SIGN LANGUAGE IS IMPLEMENTED IN PART 2 .
 
 PROBLEM STATEMENT:One afternoon, with some friends we decided to teach our computers to decipher sign language. We spent a few hours taking pictures in front of a white wall and came up with the following dataset. It's now your job to build an algorithm that would facilitate communications from a speech-impaired person to someone who doesn't understand sign language.

Training set: 1080 pictures (64 by 64 pixels) of signs representing numbers from 0 to 5 (180 pictures per number).
Test set: 120 pictures (64 by 64 pixels) of signs representing numbers from 0 to 5 (20 pictures per number).
Note that this is a subset of the SIGNS dataset. The complete dataset contains many more signs.
